## 📂 Dataset  
**File:** "Telecom_ChurnQest_Analysis.xlsx"  
**Source:** Simulated telecom customer dataset  

**Description:**  
The dataset includes customer-level details such as:  
- Demographics: 'State', 'Area Code'  
- Account Info: 'Account Lengt', 'Customer Service Calls'  
- Plan Subscriptions: 'International Plan', 'Voice Mail Plan'  
- Usage Metrics: 'Day', 'Evening', 'Night', 'International' minutes, calls, and charges  
- Target Variable: 'Churn (Yes/No)'  

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**  
- **PivotTables & PivotCharts**  
- **Formulas:** 'COUNTIF', 'AVERAGEIF', 'CORREL', 'GETPIVOTDATA'  
- **KPI Cards Design**  
- **Interactive Slicers** for filtering  
- **Conditional Formatting**  

## 📊 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Verified and formatted categorical fields like *Churn*, *International Plan*, *Voice Mail Plan*   
- Created calculated fields for churn metrics and customer usage  

Analyzed:  
- Churn count and churn percentage  
- Average account length (Churned vs. Retained)  
- Effect of *International* and *Voice Mail* plans on churn  
- Relationship between *Customer Service Calls* and churn  
- Usage vs. Churn patterns (Day, Evening, Night, Intl)  

- **Area Code–wise Churn Segmentation**  
- **Service Call Thresholds (>3 calls)** vs Churn  
- **Correlation** between Account Length and Churn  
- **International Charges** impact on Plan Subscribers  
- **Evening Usage Patterns** and Churn behavior  
- **Voice Mail Usage** interaction analysis  

## 📈 Dashboard Features  

### 🔹 KPI Cards  
- 📊 Total Customers
